# Python Based Maze Solver
Maze is stored to csv file, where the bricks and paths are represented by 0 and 1, respectively. 
The starting point and the destination is marked with ‘S’ and ‘D’, respectively.
S - starting point

D - destination

R - robot

0 - bricks

. - road



Assume a  small robot is moving from Starting point to the Destination and it can view four adjacent squares from its position. 
The robot can move either left, right, top, or bottom directions and a one square at a time.

Program print the motion of the robot in each step to the screen and keep one second delay
between each step.

Once the robot reach the destination, it print the correct path with ‘+’ sign in the
map.
